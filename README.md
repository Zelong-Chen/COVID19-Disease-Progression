# COVID19-Disease-Progression

## Abstract 
In this project we look to compare the disease progression of the COVID-19 Coronavirus in the state of California under different operating assumptions. We want to analyze the effectiveness of the implementations put in place by California state officials that are aimed to lower the spread of the Coronavirus and “flatten the curve”. We will be focusing on the analysis of the Stay-At-Home Order and Coronavirus Testing / Contact Tracing. The Stay-At-Home Order was implemented to encourage citizens to remain at home to lower the number of unnecessary social contacts between individuals in order to reduce the spread of the virus. Coronavirus Testing / Contact Tracing was used to detect asymptomatic carriers and any individuals in contact with the carriers, in order to place them into quarantine to prevent further spread of the virus to the general population. This project will look to study both of these implementations separately first to analyze each of their effectiveness. Then combining both implementations to compare the overall effects of these interventions under different operating conditions versus a baseline of the disease progression without any interventions.
